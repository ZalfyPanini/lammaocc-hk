title: About the LOCC
---
The Lamma Outrigger Canoe Club (LOCC) was founded in 2006, with two second-hand, six-person outrigger canoes and a dozen or so brave enthusiasts. We have made our home on Tai Wan To Beach (locally known as Power-Station Beach) in Yung Shue Wan, on Lamma Island (Hong Kong).\
Seven years on, we have a fleet of four six-person canoes (OC6s), two three-person canoes (OC3s) and a numerous personally owned OC1s (singles)

After years of paddling together, we have formed a tight-knit community of paddlers, but are always eager to get new people enjoying the sport and going out on the water!

We organise trainings, races, open days, and other social events! Don't hesitate to say hi :)
